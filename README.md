Some people genuinely dislike human interaction. Whenever they are forced to socialize or go to events that involve lots of people, they feel detached and awkward. Personally, I believe that I’m most extroverted because I gain energy from interacting with other people. There are plenty of people on this Earth who are the exact opposite, who get very drained from social interaction. I’m reminded of a very unique film called Her (2013). The basic premise of the film is that a man who suffers from loneliness, depression, a boring job, and an impending divorce, ends up falling in love with an AI (artificial intelligence) on his computer’s operating system. Maybe at the time this was a very science-fictiony concept, given that AI back then wasn’t advanced enough to become a surrogate human, but now? 2020? Things have changed a LOT. I fear that people will give up on finding love (or even social interaction) among humans and seek it out in the digital realm. Don’t believe me? I won’t tell you what it means, but just search up the definition of the term waifu and just cringe
